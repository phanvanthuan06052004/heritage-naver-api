Not only is it a historical relic, Ho Dynasty Citadel is also a cultural icon, a demonstration of the remarkable creativity and construction techniques of the ancient Vietnamese.

Ho Dynasty Citadel is located in a highly geographical location. To the north and west are the Buoi River, to the east are the Ma Tuong River, creating a strong natural defense system. Surrounding the city are magnificent limestone mountains, which both enhance the natural beauty and form strong walls. This position shows the strategic vision of Ho Quy Ly in selecting the site for the construction of the capital, ensuring both safety and conducive to trade and economic development.

To better understand Lake City, we need to learn about its historical background. By the end of the 14th century, Tran Dynasty had weakened, the country was in a state of crisis. Ho Quy Ly, an ambitious reformer, came to power and established the Ho Dynasty in 1400. To consolidate power and implement its reforms, Ho Quy Ly decided to move the capital from Thang Long (Hanoi today) to Tay Do (Vinh Loc, Thanh Hoa) and build House Ho City.
