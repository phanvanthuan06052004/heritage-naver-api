The story dates back to several centuries ago, but its exact timeline is difficult to pinpoint due to the lack of concrete historical records from that time period.In this tale, there was once a powerful king who had lost his precious sword during a battle. He searched for it everywhere but could not find it. One day, while riding on his elephant, he saw a turtle carrying the sword in its mouth. The king asked the turtle where he found the sword, and the turtle replied that it had been given to him by a divine being.To honor the turtle's kindness, the king decided to return the sword to its home. He built a boat and embarked on a journey to reach the turtle's underwater kingdom. Upon arriving, he presented the sword to the turtle and promised to protect it forever. After fulfilling his promise, the king returned to his kingdom with the grateful turtle following closely behind.While the exact date of when this legend took place is unknown, it represents the deep cultural connection between the people of Champa and their reverence for nature and animals.
